# Voron V0.1 Klipper Config

This is the config for my Voron V0.1 printer modified from the [Voron 0.1 Stock Printer Config Example](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-0/blob/Voron0.1/Firmware/skr-mini-E3-v2.0.cfg)

Built with an LDO V0.1 kit, V0.1 aluminum parts kit, and LDO Kirigami bed kit. Mainboard is the BTT SKR Mini E3 V2.0 (included in the LDO kit) and in place of a raspberry pi I am using an Asus Tinker Board.
